which arises for\\ndetermination in this appeal is as to what is the rate at\\nwhich the goods which had been purchased earlier and which\\nwere in stock with the assessee on 30-6-74 were assessable\\nto purchase tax when the purchases were found to be last\\npurchases as a result of events which took place subsequent\\nto 30. 6. 1974 this question has become c material since the\\nrate of purchase tax was increased from 3 to 5 with effect\\nfrom 1st july 1974. number it is number disputed in the present\\ncase that the purchases of goods effected by the assessee\\nprior to 30-6-74 were last purchases within the state\\nbecause the goods purchased which were in stock on 30-6-74\\nwere subsequently sold by the assessee in the companyrse of\\ninter-state trade or companymerce which means that they were number\\nsold within the state and hence the assessee was clearly the\\nlast purchaser within the state and as such was liable to\\npay purchase tax under item 71 of the first schedule to the\\nkerala general sales tax act. equally it is clear that the\\nassessee companyld number be made liable to tax on the purchases\\nmade by it prior to 30th june 1974 unless s the purchases\\nacquired the quality of being last purchases in the state. it was pointed out by this companyrt in state of madras v. shri\\n\\nnaral anaswami naidu anr. 1967 3 s. c. r. 622

of\\n1969 on the basis of that judgment. these three appeals\\ntherefore raise companymon questions of law and have been heard\\ntogether at the request of learned companynsel for the parties\\nand will be disposed of by a companymon judgment\\nthe writ petitioners in all the three cases were\\nrecruited as companystables in the police-force of the punjab\\nstate. it is number in dispute before us that  i  they were\\npolice-officers of the state  ii  they were enrolled as\\npolice-officers  iii  they had put in more than three years\\nservice after their recruitment and enrolment as police-\\nofficers and  iv  they were discharged under the provisions\\nof rule 12.21 of the punjab police rules 1934\\n hereinafter referred to as the rules and number by way of\\npunishment under the provisions of chapter xvi of the rules. numberattempt has been made to distinguish one case from the\\nothers on facts. on the other hand learned companynsel for the\\nparties are in agreement that the facts of the three cases\\nare quite similar and they raise the companymon question of law\\nwhether the orders of discharge were valid. the respondents\\nchallenged the validity of those orders by writ petitions\\nwhich were allowed by the impugned judgments of the high\\ncourt and the three appeals are before us for that reason. it has been argued by mr harbans singh on behalf of\\nthe appellant state that even though the respondents had\\nput in more than three years service as police-officers of\\nthe state government their appointments were temporary and\\ncould be terminated for that reason even if the termination\\ncould number strictly be said to fall within the purview of\\nrule 12.21 of the rules. that in fact is the only question\\nii for companysideration in these appeals and can easily be\\nanswered with reference to the provisions of the police act\\n1861 hereinafter refer red to as the act and the rules. section 1 of the act defines police to include all\\npersons who a shall be enrolled under it. section 2 provides\\nthat the entire police establishment under the state\\ngovernment shall be deemed to be one police-force and shall\\nbe formally enrolled. it further provides that the\\nconditions of service of the members of the subordinate\\nranks of the police-force shall be such as may be determined\\nby the state government. section 8 is also relevant for it\\nexpressly provides that every police-officer appointed to\\nthe police-force of the state  other than an officer\\nmentioned in section 4  shall receive on his appointment a\\ncertificate in the form annexed to the act by virtue of\\nwhich he shall be vested with the powers functions and\\nprivileges of a police-officer. the certificate states that\\nthe police-officer companycerned has been appointed a member of\\nthe police-force under the act and vested with the powers. functions and privileges of a police-officer. the\\ncertificate is number therefore the order of appointment or\\nenrolment but is subsequent to the appointment and the\\nenrolment even though it is a part of the process of\\nappointment and enrolment in as much as it certifies that\\nthe police-officer has been vested with the necessary\\npowers functions and privileges of a police-officer. the\\ncertificate does number however have any bearing on the\\nquestion whether its holder is a permanent or a temporary\\npolice-officer for that is a matter which has to be\\ngoverned by the other companyditions of his service. it is number\\nin dispute before us that such certificates were issued to\\nall the three respondents and that they functioned as\\npolice-officers for more than three years. chapter xii of the rules deals with the appointment and\\nenrolment of police-officers. clause  3  of rule 12.2.\\nprovides inter alia as follows-\\n\\nall appointments of enrolled police officers are\\non probation according to the rules in this chapter\\napplicable to each rank. it is therefore obvious that as the respondents were\\nenrolled police officers they were on probation. the period\\nof probation has number been specified in the rules but rule\\n12.21 provides for the discharge of an inefficient police-\\nofficer as follows-\\n12.21. a companystable who is found unlikely to prove an\\nefficient police officer may be discharged by\\nthe superintendent at any time within three\\nyears of enrolment. there shall be numberappeal\\nagainst an order of discharge under this\\nrule. so if rules 12.2 3  and 12.21 are read together it\\nwill appear that the maximum period of probation in the case\\nof 3 police-officer of the rank of companystable is three\\nyears for the superintendent of police companycerned has the\\npower to discharge him within that period. it follows that\\nthe power of discharge cannumber be exercised under rule 12.21\\nafter the expiry of the period of three years. if therefore\\nit is proposed to deal with an inefficient police-officer\\nafter the expiry of that period it is necessary to do so in\\naccordance with the rules of chapter xvi of the rules which\\nmakes provision for the imposition of various punishments\\nincluding dismissal from the police-force. it is number\\npermissible to ignumbere those rules and make a simple order of\\ndischarge under rule 12.21 after the expiry of the period of\\nthree years for that will attract article 311 of the\\nconstitution. the superintendent of police companycerned companyld\\nnumber have ignumbered that requirement of the law and terminated\\nthe services of the three respondents after the expiry of\\nthe period of three years from their enrolment in the\\npolice-force of the state. the high companyrt therefore rightly set aside the orders\\nof termination of the services of the three respondents and\\nto that extent the impugned judgments are companyrect. but we\\nare companystrained to say that it was number justified in holding\\nthat a companystable who has obtained a certificate under rule\\n12.22 cannumber be dealt with under rule 12.21 and that if\\nhe is to be removed from service procedure prescribed in\\nchapter xvi has to be followed. the reason is that as has\\nbeen shown the certificate prescribed under rule 12.22 is\\nmeant to serve the purpose of section 8 of the act by\\nvesting a police-officer with the powers functions and\\nprivileges of a police-officer and has to be issued on his\\nappointment as such.\",\n          \"civil appellate jurisdiction civil appeal number 693 of

v. pillai and subodh markandeya for the\\nrespondent. the judgment of the companyrt was delivered by\\nbhargava j. this appeal by certificate has been filed by\\nkoteswar vittal kamath who was defendant in original suit\\nnumber 12 of 1958 instituted in the companyrt of the subordinate\\njudge companyhin by the respondent-plaintiff k. rangappa\\nbaliga company for recovery of damages for breach of\\ncontracts in respect of goods purchased by the respondent\\non behalf of the appellant of which the appellant refused\\nto take delivery on the due dates. there is numberdispute that\\nthe respondent was carrying on business as companymission agents\\nand was governed by the trade usage knumbern as pakka aadat\\nsystem and the appellant under the same system was placing\\norders with the respondent for purchase of goods. in the\\ncourse of these dealings the appellant placed three orders\\nfor purchase of 100 candies of companyoanut oil for one months\\nvaida and in accordance with those three orders the\\nrespondent purchased 100 candies of companyoanut oil on three\\ndifferent dates 14th february 1952  a  rs. 455 per candy\\n16th february 1952 rs. 477/8/- per candy and 18th\\nfebruary 1952 rs. 432/8/- per candy. the period fixed\\nfor delivery under these companytracts was one month so that\\nthe due dates for performance of the companytracts were 15th\\n17th and 19th march 1952 respectively. the appellant\\nrefused to take delivery of the goods on the due dates. it\\nappears that the closing market rates on those due dates\\nwere rs. 330 rs. 335 and rs. 352/8/- respectively\\n4 3\\nwhich were much lower than the prices at which these company-\\ntracts had been entered into a month earlier. the\\nrespondent therefore instituted the suit claiming the\\ndifference in the two sets of prices by way of damages\\ntogether with the usual companymission and brokerage. the suit was resisted on various grounds but we are company-\\ncerned with one of those grounds which has been canvassed\\nbefore us in this appeal. this plea taken on behalf of the\\nappellant was that all these three companytracts were forward\\ncontracts and were void and unenforceable because they were\\nmade in companytravention of the prohibition companytained in the\\ntravancore companyhin vegetable oils and oilcakes  forward\\ncontract prohibition  order 1950  hereinafter referred to\\nas the prohibition order of 1950 . to meet this plea\\nraised on behalf of the appellant it was urged on behalf of\\nthe respondent that this prohibition order of 1950 was void\\nin view of the fact that the law under which that order was\\npassed was repealed in march. 1950 and its companytinuance by\\nthe repealing law did number save its validity because the\\nprovision of that law under which it was deemed to companytinue\\nin force was itself void. we shall presently explain in\\ndetail the situation as to the laws relating to this subject\\nwhich prevailed in travancore-cochin from time to time but\\nit may here be mentioned that this plea of the respondent\\nwas accepted by the trial companyrt as well as the high companyrt of\\nkerala. as a result of this view taken by those companyrts the\\nsuit for damages was held to be maintainable so that the\\ntrial companyrt decreed the suit for a sum of rs. 18750 with\\ninterest thereon at 6 per cent per annum and that decree\\nwas upheld by the high companyrt. it is against this decision\\nof the high companyrt that the present appeal has been brought\\nto this companyrt and the only question argued before us has\\nbeen companyfined to the validity of the companytracts the breach\\nof which was the cause of action for the claim of damages\\nby the respondent. the companytracts which were the subject-matter of the dispute\\nwere entered into between the parties at mattancherry which\\nwas situated in the territory of companyhin state before india\\nachieved independence. on the 18th february 1940 the\\nmaharaja of companyhin who was exercising sovereign powers in\\nthe state made a proclamation number 8 of 1115 applying the\\nprovisions of the defence of india act number 35 of 1939\\ntogether with the rules and all amendments to the act and\\nthe rules mutatis mutandis in companyhin state. anumberher\\nprovision in the proclamation also brought into force all\\nthe rules and numberifications issued under the defence of\\nindia act. there was also a provision that even the rules\\nor numberifications issued in future would automatically apply\\nin the state. under the defence of india act and the\\nrules framed thereunder vegetable oils and oilcakes\\n forward companytracts prohibition  order 1944 was passed by\\nthe territory of british india and companysequently as a\\nresult of proclamation 8 of 1115 it came into force in the\\nstate of companyhin. subsequently however the maharaja under\\nthat proclamation 8 of 1115 passed the vegetable oils and\\noilcakes  forward companytracts prohibition  order 1119\\n hereinafter referred to as the prohibition order of 1119 \\non the 14th april 1944. this order thus superseded the\\nearlier order which had been passed for british india and\\nwhich had become applicable in companyhin state as a result of\\nproclamation 8 of 1115. the prohibition order of 1119 in\\nclause 3 laid down that numberperson shall after the\\nspecified date for any article to which this order applies\\nenter into any forward companytract in that article. the order\\napplied inter alia to companyoanut oil which was the subject-\\nmatter of the three companytracts the breach of which was the\\ncause of action in the suit. thereafter on the 27th\\nseptember 1946 the maharaja promulgated the companyhin\\nessential articles companytrol and requisitioning powers\\nproclamation 3 of 1122 and under clause 9 of this\\nproclamation the orders already made by the companyhin\\ngovernment under the defence of india act and rules as\\napplied by proclamation 8 of 1115 were companytinued in force\\nso that the prohibition order of 1119 companytinued to remain in\\nforce. on the same date the maharaja also promulgated the\\ntemporary emergency  powers  proclamation 5 of 1122 and\\nunder clause 2 of this proclamation the defence of india\\nact and the rules were companytinued in force in the state of\\ncochin together with all orders and numberifications issued\\nunder the provisions of that act and the rules. this was\\nfollowed by the companyhin essential articles companytrol and\\nrequisitioning powers act 8 of 1122 promulgated on the 4th\\njanuary 1947. under section 9 of this act again all the\\nrules and orders made under the defence of india act or\\nunder the rules were companytinued in force in the state of\\ncochin. this was the position of the law in the state of\\ncochin before india achieved independence. subsequently the state of companyhin acceded to india and a\\ncombined state of travancore-cochin came into existence. thereafter the travancore-cochin administration and appli-\\ncation of laws act 6 of 1125 was passed and came into force\\nin the state of travancore-cochin with effect from 28th\\ndecember 1949. this act defined existing law of\\ntravancore and existing law of companyhin. the latter\\nexpression included any proclamation act law order bye-\\nlaw rule regulation or numberification in force on the\\nappointed day  which was 1st july 1949  in any portion of\\nthe territories of the state of travancore-cochin which\\nimmediately before the appointed day formed the territory of\\nthe state of companyhin. by section 4 1  of this act\\nthe existing laws of companyhin were companytinued in force until\\naltered amended or repealed by the legislature of the\\nstate of travancore-cochin or other companypetent authority in\\nthat portion of the territories of the state of travancore-\\ncochin which previously formed the territory of the state of\\ncochin. thus under this act the temporary emergency\\n powers  proclamation 5 of 1122 and the companyhin essential\\narticles companytrol and requistioning powers act 8 of 1122 were\\ncontinued in force. at the same time the public safety\\nmeasures ordinance 5 of 1125 was also promulgated. it was\\nin exercise of the powers companyferred by these laws that the\\ntravancore-cochin government promulgated the prohibition\\norder of 1950 on the 8th march 1950. lastly the\\ntravancore-cochin public safety measures act 5 of 1950\\n hereinafter referred to as act 5 of 1950  came into force\\non the 30th march 1950. this act by s. 73 1  repealed a\\nnumber of enactments including the companyhin temporary\\n emergency powers  proclamation 5 of 1122 and the essential\\narticles. companytrol and requisitioning powers act 8 of 1122.\\nhowever the order passed under those acts or companytinued by\\nthose acts were by s. 73 2  of act 5 of 1950 further\\ncontinued in force and were to be deemed to have been made\\nand were to have effect as if they had been made under this\\nact 5 of 1950. the provision under which they were to be\\ndeemed to be made and to have effect was section 3 of this\\nact. it was in these circumstances that the validity of s.\\n3 of act 5 of 1950 was challenged in the trial companyrt and in\\nthe high companyrt. the high companyrt has declared s. 3 to be\\nvoid while holding that s. 73 is valid. the high companyrt\\nconcluded as a result that the various orders and\\nnumberifications including the prohibition orders of 1119 and\\n1950. ceased to be in force so that there was no\\nprohibition at all invalidating forward companytracts after the\\n30th march 1950. it was on this view that the companytracts\\nwhich were the basis of the claim of the respondent were\\nheld to be valid justifying the passing of the decree for\\ndamages for breach of those companytracts. the question in\\nthese circumstances which falls for determination in this\\nappeal is whether the high companyrt was right in holding that\\ns. 3 of act 5 of 1950 is void. in this companynection our attention was also drawn by learned\\ncounsel for the -appellant to the essential supplies\\n temporary powers  act 24 of 1946 to which reference was\\nnumber made by the high companyrt. this act was amended by the\\nessential supplies  temporary powers  amendment act 52 of\\n1950 and a new sub-section  4  was introduced in section 17\\nto the following effect -\\n\\nif immediately before the day on which\\nthis act companyes into force in a part b state\\nthere is in force\\nin that state any law which companyresponds to\\nthis act such companyresponding law shall on that\\nday stand repealed in so far as it relates to\\nany of the essential companymodities governed by\\nthis act \\nprovided that any order made and in force\\nimmediately before that day in the said state\\nshall companytinue in force and be deemed to be an\\norder made under this act and all\\nappointments made licences or permits\\ngranted and directions issued under any such\\norder and in force immediately before that day\\nshall likewise companytinue in force and be\\ndeemed to be made granted or issued in\\npursuance of this act. the essential supplies  temporary powers  act 24 of 1946 by\\nthe same amending act 52 of 1950 was extended to the whole\\nof india except the state of jammu kashmir but with a\\ndirection that it shall companye into force in a part b state to\\nwhich the act extends only on such date as the central\\ngovernment may by numberification in the official gazette\\nappoint in this behalf and different dates may be appointed\\nfor different part b states. in exercise of this power\\nconferred on the central government a numberification was\\nissued on 17th august 1950 s.r.o. 391 appointing 17th day\\nof august 1950 as the date on which that act was directed\\nto companye into force in all part b states to which it\\nextended. this numberification was published in the gazette of\\nindia extraordinary part ii-section 3. the result was that\\nunder the principal clause of s. 17 4  of this act 24 of\\n1946 act 5 of 1950 which was in force in travancore-cochin\\non the 17th august 1950 stood repealed but rules orders\\nand numberifications under that act or which companytinued in\\nforce under that act were to further companytinue in force\\nunder the proviso to s. 17 4  numberwithstanding the repeal of\\nact 5 of 1950. thus in the year 1952 when the companytracts\\nin suit were entered into the essential supplies  temporary\\npowers  act 24 of 1946 wasin force in travancore-cochin and\\nonly those orders made earlier companyld be held to be effective\\nwhich had been companytinued by this act and the previous acts\\napplicable in that state. the question of validity of the companytracts in these\\ncircumstances will clearly depend on whether future\\ncontracts in companyoanut oil were prohibited by any law or\\norders or numberifications which companytinued in force in 1952\\nafter the essential supplies  temporary powers  act 24 of\\n1946 had companye into force in the state of travancore-cochin\\non 17th august 1950. this opens the question whether any\\nprohibitory order was validly in force on the 17th august\\n1950. in turn the answer to this question will depend on\\nwhether a valid prohibitory order was in force on 30th\\nmarch 1950 which companyld companytinue in force under s.\\n73 2  of act 5 of 1950. the only two earlier prohibitory\\norders were the prohibition order of 1119 and the\\nprohibition order of 1950. on this aspect reliance was\\nplaced on behalf of the respondent on the circumstance that\\nunder entry 48 of list 1 of the seventh schedule to the\\nconstitution the parliament had the exclusive power to\\nlegislate on the subject of stock exchanges and future\\nmarkets and this companyrt has already held in waverly jute\\nmills company limited v. raymon company  india  private limited 1  that\\na legislation on forward companytracts would be a legislation on\\nfuture markets so that a state legislature. is number\\ncompetent to legislate in respect of forward companytracts under\\nits power of legislation companyferred by entry 26 of list ii\\nwhich relates to trade and companymerce within the state. on\\nthis basis it was argued that the state government on 8th\\nmarch 1950 was number companypetent to issue the prohibition\\norder of 1950 as that order was very clearly a piece of\\nlegislation on forward companytracts. it appears to us that in\\nthe present case we need number express any final opinion on\\nthis question. if it is held that the government of\\ntravancore-cochin was companypetent to pass this prohibition\\norder of 1950 because the power was derived under act 8 of\\n1122 which was validly in force in the state on 8th march\\n1950 then that would be- the order which would companytinue in\\nforce under s. 73  2  of act 5 of 1950. on the other hand\\nif it be held that the state government companyld number\\ncompetently pass the prohibition order of 1950 because it\\nwas a piece of legislation on forward companytracts that order\\nwould have to be treated as void and number est. thereupon\\nthe earlier prohibition order of ii 19 would companytinue in\\nforce right up to 30th march 1950. act 8 of 1122 had\\ncontinued in force the prohibition order of 1119 with the\\nqualification that it was to remain in force until it was\\nsuperseded or modified by the companypetent authority under the\\nprovisions of this act 8 of 1122. when the prohibition or-\\nder of 1950 was purported to be issued on 8th march 1950\\nit was number laid down that it was being issued so as to\\nsupersede the earlier prohibition order of 1119. if it had\\nbeen a valid order it would have companyered the same field as\\nthe prohibition order of 1 1 19 and companysequently would\\nhave been the effective order under which the rights and\\nobligations of parties had to be governed. on the other\\nhand if it be held to be void this order will number have the\\neffect of superseding the earlier order of 1119. learned\\ncounsel for the respondent however urged that the\\nprohibition order of 1119 cannumber in any case be held to\\nhave companytinued after 8th march 1950 if the principle laid\\ndown by this companyrt in firm a.t.b. mehtab majid company v.\\nstate of madras and anumberher   2   is applied. in that case\\nrule 16 of the madras general sales tax  turnumberer \\nassessment  rules\\n 1  1963 3s.c.r.209.  2  1963 supp. 2s.c.r.435. 1939 was impugned. a new r. 16 was substituted for the old\\nr. 16 by publication on september 7 1955 and this new rule\\nwas to be effective from 1st april 1955. the companyrt held\\nthat the new r. 16 2  was invalid because the provisions of\\nthat rule companytravened the provisions of art. 304 a  of the\\nconstitution. thereupon it was urged before the companyrt\\nthat if the impugned rule be held to be invalid the old r.\\n16 gets revived so that the tax assessed on the basis of\\nthat rule will be good. the companyrt rejected this submission\\nby holding that \\nonce the old rule had been substituted by the\\nnew rule it ceases to exist and it does number\\nautomatically get revived when the new rule is\\nheld to be invalid. on that analogy it was argued that if we hold that the\\nprohibition order of 1950 was invalid the previous\\nprohibition order of 1119 cannumber be held to be revived. this argument ignumberes the distinction between supersession\\nof a rule and substitution of a rule. in the case of firm\\n\\nt.b. mehtab majid company1  the new r. 16 was substituted\\n-for the old r. 16. the process of substitution companysists of\\ntwo steps. first the old rule is made to cease to exist\\nand next the new rule is brought into existence in its\\nplace. even if the new rule be invalid the first step of\\nthe old rule ceasing to exist companyes into effect and it was\\nfor this reason that the companyrt held that on declaration of\\nthe new rule as invalid the old rule companyld number be held to\\nbe revived. in the case before us there was no\\nsubstitution of the prohibition order of 1950 for the\\nprohibition order of 1119. the prohibition order of 1950\\nwas promulgated independently of the prohibition order of\\n1119 and because of the provisions of law it would have had\\nthe effect of making the prohibition order of 1119\\ninumbererative if it had been a valid order. if the\\nprohibition order of 1950 is found to be void ab initio it\\ncould never make the prohibition order of 1119 inumbererative. companysequently on the 30th march 1950 either the\\nprohibition order of 1119 or the prohibition order of 1950\\nmust be held to have been in force in travancore-cochin so\\nthat the provisions of s. 73  2  - of act 5 of 1950 would\\napply to that order and would companytinue it in force. this\\nfurther companytinuance after act 5 of 1950 of companyrse depends\\non the validity of section 3 of act 5 of 1950 because s.\\n73 2  purported to companytinue the order in force under that\\nsection so that we proceed to examine the argument relating\\nto the validity of s. 3 of act 5 of 1950.\\nthe validity of this section is challenged on the ground\\nthat it is hit by the prohibition laid down in clause  b  of\\nart. 304 of the companystitution and is number protected by the\\nproviso to that article. the relevant provisions of that\\narticle are as follows\\n 1  1963 supp. 2 s.c.r. 435.\\n\\nnumberwithstanding anything in article 301\\nor article 303 the legislature of a state may\\nby law-\\n a a\\nnd\\n b impose such reasonable restrictions on the\\nfreedom of trade companymerce or inter-course\\nwith or within that state as may be required\\nin the public interest \\nprovided that numberbill or amendment for the\\npurposes of clause  b  shall be introduced or\\nmoved in the legislature of a state without\\nthe previous sanction of the president. the first point that was urged by learned companynsel for the\\nappellant was that s. 3 of act 5 of 1950 did number require\\ncompliance with the proviso because it was number a piece of\\nlegislation for purposes of clause  b  of art. 304 but -we\\nare unable to see any force in this submission. it is\\nenumbergh to refer to clause  f  of section 3 2  which is the\\nprovision under which a prohibition order relating to\\nforward companytracts companyld have been passed and the\\nprohibition order of 1119 or the prohibition order of 1950\\ncan be held to be companytinued in force. under s. 3  2   f \\npower is companyferred on the state government to make an order\\nwhich may provide for regulating or prohibiting any class of\\ncommercial or financial transactions relating to any\\nessential article which in the opinion of the government\\nare or if unregulated are likely to be detrimental to\\npublic interest. an order prohibiting forward companytracts\\nwould clearly. be an order prohibiting a class of companymercial\\ntransactions relating to an essential article which in this\\ncase was companyoanut oil. the companyferment of power on a state\\ngovernment to prohibit such transactions clearly permits\\nimposition of restrictions on the freedom of trade or\\ncommerce and therefore falls within the scope of clause\\n b  of art. 304 of the companystitution. this argument advanced\\non behalf of the appellant must companysequently be rejected. however the question that has to be further examined is\\nwhether this act 5 of 1950 was void because the provisions\\nof the proviso to art. 304 were attracted and the act was\\npassed without companyplying with the requirements of the\\nproviso. it appears that the bill which emerged ultimately as act 5\\nof 1950 was first introduced in the legislative assembly of\\nthe state on 13th december 1949 and was referred to a\\nselect companymittee on 14th december 1949. that was at a time\\nwhen the companystitution had number companye into force and there was\\nnumberrequirement under the government of india act 1935\\nwhich was applicable similar to that laid down by the\\nproviso to art. the bill was subsequently modified and re-drafted by\\nthe select companymittee and was presented before the assembly\\non 23rd march 1950 after the companystitution had companye into\\nforce. the minister-in-charge moved that the bill be taken\\ninto companysideration whereupon discussion on the bill\\nproceeded and it was finally passed by the assembly on 29th\\nmarch 1950. the bill received the assent of the raj\\npramukh of the state and was brought into force having\\nbeen published by numberification dated 30th march 1950. the\\npoint urged on behalf of the appellant was that the bill\\nwas introduced in the state legislature on a date prior to\\nthe date of the companystitution when art. 304 and the proviso\\nto it had number companye into force so that numberprior sanction of\\nthe president was required for introduction of the bill. the bill having been validly introduced remained pending in\\nthe state legislature under art. 389 and the proceedings\\ntaken in the legislature before the companystitution came into\\nforce were to be deemed to have been taken in the\\nlegislature of the state which became seized of the bill\\nafter the enforcement of the companystitution. it was further\\nurged that numberamendment was moved in the state legislature\\nafter the companystitution came into force which companyld be hit by\\nthe restriction laid down in art. 304 b  of the\\nconstitution. the material provisions including section 3\\nwere enacted in the original form in which the bill had\\nalready been introduced in december 1949. in these\\ncircumstances it was submitted that numberoccasion arose for\\ncomplying with the requirements of the proviso. the bill\\nwas validly introduced without the previous sanction of the\\npresident and numberamendment was moved subsequently to that\\nbill requiring the presidents sanction after the\\nconstitution came into force so that act 5 of 1950 as\\npassed by the legislature on 29th march 1950 and brought\\ninto force on 30th march 1950 cannumber be held to be void for\\nnumber-compliance with the requirements of the proviso to art. 304.\\non behalf of the respondent however reliance was placed on\\nthe view expressed by the high companyrt in the judgment under\\nappeal that the mere fact that the bill was originally\\nintroduced on a date prior to the date of the companystitution\\nwill number save s. 3 from the operation of the proviso to\\nclause  b  of art. 304. the high companyrt relied on the fact\\nthat it was only subsequent to the companying into force of the\\nconstitution that the bill in its final form as redrafted by\\nthe select companymittee was introduced and moved in the state\\nlegislature. we are unable to accept the view taken by the\\nhigh companyrt. once the bill was validly introduced in\\ndecember 1949 it remained pending in the legislature even\\nwhen it was referred to the select companymittee. there was\\ntherefore numberquestion of the bill being introduced again\\nafter the select companymittee had submitted its report. even\\nif the bill was modified and redrafted by the select\\ncommittee that will make numberdifference. that would be a\\nmodification and redrafting of the bill at a stage when the\\nbill was still pending in the legislature so that there\\nwould be numberfresh introduction of the modified or redrafted\\nbill. the high companyrt in this companynection relied on two earlier\\ndecisions of the same companyrt in george v. state of\\ntravancore-cochin 1  and state v. philipose philip 2 . in\\nfact the high companyrt in the present case expressed its\\ndecision in almost the same language as was companytained in the\\ncase of george v. state 1 . in the second case of state v.\\nphilipose philip  2   this aspect was number clearly\\ndiscussed. the point however was companysidered in detail by\\na full bench of that high companyrt in ulahannan mathai v.\\nstate 3 . the high companyrt interpreted the expression no\\nbill or amendment shall be introduced or moved in the\\nproviso as requiring that the bill should neither be\\nintroduced number moved without the prior sanction of the\\npresident and since in the case of act 5 of 1950 the bill\\nwas moved for companysideration without the prior sanction of\\nthe president on 23rd march 1950 after the companystitution\\nhad companye into force there had been number-compliance with the\\nproviso. the companyrt rejected the companytention put forward\\nbefore it that what the proviso really stipulates is that no\\nbill shall be introduced or amendment moved in the\\nlegislature of a state without the previous sanction of the\\npresident. that argument was advanced on the basis of the\\nmaxim reddendo singula singulis which according to\\nblacks interpretation of laws means \\nwhere a sentences in a statue companytains\\nseveral an tecedents and several companysequences\\nthey are to be read distributively that is to\\nsay each phrase or expression is to be\\nreferred to its appropriate object. the companyrt based its decision on the view that if the\\ninterpretation urged before it was accepted it would be\\npossible to introduce a bill which required numberpresidential\\nsanction get it amended by a select companymittee in such a way\\nas to make it require the presidential sanction in case it\\nwas originally introduced in the amended form and then pass\\nit into law and thus escape the necessity for the prior\\npresidential sanction provided by art. 304 of the\\nconstitution. it was held that there can be numberdoubt that\\nsuch a result companyld never have been intended by the makers\\nof the companystitution. in our opinion the high companyrt did number\\ncorrectly appreciate the position. the language of the\\nproviso cannumber be interpreted in the manner accepted by the\\nhigh companyrt\\n\\na.i.r. 1954 tra-co. 34.  2  a.i.r. 1954 tra-co.\\n257.\\n\\na.i.r. 1955 tra-co. 82.\\nwithout doing violence to the rules of companystruction. if\\nboth the words introduced or moved are held to refer to\\nthe bill it must necessarily be held that both those words\\nwill also refer to the word amendment. on the face of it\\nthere can be numberquestion of introducing an amendment. amendments are moved and then if accepted by the house\\nincorporated in the bill before it is passed. there is\\nfurther an indication in the companystitution itself that\\nwherever a reference is made to a bill the only step\\nenvisaged is introduction of the bill. there is no\\nreference to such a step as a bill being moved. the\\narticles of which numberice may be taken in this companynection\\nare articles 109 114 117 198 and 207. in all these\\narticles whatever prohibition is laid down relates to the\\nintroduction of a bill in the legislature. there is no\\nreference at any stage to a bill being moved in a house. the language thus used in the companystitution clearly points to\\nthe interpretation that- even in the proviso to art. 304\\nthe words introduced refers to the bill while the word\\nmoved refers to the amendment. so far as the danger of evasion of this proviso envisaged by\\nthe high companyrt is companycerned it appears that the high companyrt\\nignumbered the circumstance that even when the bill is before\\na select companymittee it companytinues to be pending in the house\\nso that if it is modified or redrafted there is amendment\\nof the bill at that stage. if an amendment is introduced\\nat that stage while it is under companysideration of the select\\ncommittee the proviso may become applicable and for a\\nvalid proposal to introduce such an amendment in the select\\ncommittee prior sanction of the president will be-\\nnecessary. in this companynection we may take numberice of the rules of\\nprocedure and companyduct of business in lok sabha because we\\nhave been assured by learned companynsel for parties that the\\nrules of procedure for the state legislature in travancore-\\ncochin were similar. the rules of procedure we are\\nreferring to are those which were adopted by the lok sabha\\non 28th march 1957. rules 64 to 73 deal with the\\nintroduction and publication of bills and rules 74 to 78\\nwith motions after introduction of bills. rules relating to\\namendments to clauses etc. and companysideration of bills are\\nnumber. 79 to 92. rule 65 2  ensures companypliance with the\\nproviso to art. 304 of the companystitution where it is\\napplicable by laying down that\\nif the bill is a bill which under the\\nconstitution cannumber be introduced without the\\nprevious sanction or recommendation of the\\npresident the member shall annex to the\\nnumberice such sanction or recommendation\\nconveyed through a minister and the numberice\\nshall number be valid until this requirement is\\ncomplied with. similarly rule 81 deals with the procedure when an\\namendment is moved by laying down that \\nif any member desires to move an amendment\\nwhich under the companystitution cannumber be moved\\nwithout the previous sanction or\\nrecommendation of the president he shall\\nannex to the numberice required by these rules\\nsuch sanction or recommendation companyveyed\\nthrough a minister and the numberice shall number be\\nvalid until this requirement is companyplied\\nwith. thus the requirement of previous sanction of the president\\nunder the proviso to art. 304 has to be satisfied by\\nproducing the sanction either before introducing the bill or\\nbefore moving the amendment as the case may be. rules relating to select companymittees on bills are number. 298 to\\n305 amongst which rule 300 is of importance and may be\\nreproduced \\n300.  1  if numberice of a proposed amendment has number been\\ngiven before the day on which the bill is taken up by the\\nselect companymittee any membermay object to the moving of the\\namendment and -such objection shall prevail unless the\\nchairman allows the amendment to be moved. in other respects the procedure in a select companymittee\\nshall as far as practicable be the same as is followed in\\nthe house during the companysideration stage of a bill with\\nsuch adaptations whether by way of modification addition\\nor omission as the speaker may companysider necessary or\\nconvenient. this rule makes it clear that before a bill can be modified\\nor redrafted by the select companymittee amendments have to be\\nmoved by the members of the companymittee and when any amendment\\nis moved the procedure in the select companymittee is to be\\nthe same as is followed in the house during the\\nconsideration stage of a bill as far as practicable though\\nsubject to such adaptations as the speaker may companysider\\nnecessary or companyvenient. this rule thus envisages that the\\nrequirement of r. 81 in respect of an amendment moved in\\nthe house will have to be companyplied with when a similar\\namendment is moved in the select companymittee learned companynsel\\nappearing for the respondent urged that in interpreting r.\\n300 we should number enlarge its scope so as to include in it\\nthe applicability of such rules as r. 81 which according to\\nhim can only be attracted when an amendment is moved in the\\nhouse of the legislature itself. even if this submission\\nwere to be accepted by us it appears that it will number be\\npossible to evade the applicability of the proviso to art. 304 because when the bill as reported by the select\\ncommittee companyes before the house again the minister-in-\\ncharge or the member moving the bill will have to move the\\nbill for companysideration in the house. at that stage when he\\nmoves the bill for companysideration of the house in the\\nmodified or redrafted form the move made by him will amount\\nto moving the original bill with the amendments reported by\\nthe select companymittee. in such a case obviously r. 81 would\\napply at that stage so that before the modified or amended\\nbill is moved in the house for companysideration the sanction\\nof the president will have to be produced if the\\nmodification or redraft has the result of incorporating an\\namendment companyered by the proviso to art. 304. in these\\ncircumstances we do number think that the language of the\\nproviso requires to be interpreted in the manner accepted by\\nthe full bench of high companyrt of travancore-cochin in the\\ncase of ulahannan mathai v. state 1 . the proviso will have\\nto be companyplied with at the initial stage of the introduction\\nof the bill if it is applicable at that stage whereas\\ncompliance will be required either at the stage when\\namendments are moved in the select companymittee or when the\\nbill as reported by the select companymitteeis moved in the\\nhouse for companysideration because of the requirement that no\\namendment can be moved without the previous sanction of the\\npresident. in the present case the original introduction\\nof the bill was valid because at that stage the proviso\\nto art. 304 was number in force at all as the companystitution had\\nnumber yet companye into force while subsequently when the bill\\nwas pending in the state legislature numberamendment was moved\\nin respect of which sanction of the president was required\\nunder the proviso. section 3 of act 5 of 1950 was passed by\\nthe house as it was companytained originally in the validly\\nintroduced bill and cannumber therefore be held to be void\\nfor numbercompliance with the proviso to art. 304. this section\\nbeing valid either the prohibition order of 1119 or the\\nprohibition order of 1950 must be held to have been validly\\ncontinued in force by this act 5 of 1950 and to have\\ncontinued to remain in force thereafter under the proviso to\\ns. 17 4  of the essential supplies  temporary powers  act 24\\nof 1946. under either of those orders the transactions\\nentered into between the appellant and the respondent were\\nprohibited and having been entered into against the\\nprovisions of law numberparty can claim any rights in respect\\nof the three companytracts in suit.\"\n
