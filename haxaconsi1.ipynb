The case before us involves a contractual arbitration clause from a 2008 tender issued by the Punjab State Water Supply Sewerage Board, Bhatinda.\n","\n","The clause in question requires any party seeking arbitration to deposit 10% of the claim amount with the arbitrator. This deposit is refundable only in proportion to the amount awarded, with the remainder forfeited. This provision, appellant argues, is arbitrary and serves as a barrier to accessing arbitration.\n","\n","Our duty, ladies and gentlemen, is not to merely win this case, but to seek justice. In this spirit, we acknowledge that while the arbitration clause may appear on its surface to be burdensome, it was a crucial component of ensuring fairness in contractual disagreements.\n","\n","The clause was designed to prevent frivolous or vexatious claims. It mandates the appellant to deposit 10% of the claim amount, which can only be refunded in proportion to the amount awarded. This provision discourages parties from initiating baseless claims, as they are required to commit a significant portion of their claim amount upfront.\n","\n","We also recognize that some may view this clause as unreasonably high. However, the arbitration process is inherently voluntary and aims to provide a more efficient, quicker, and cost-effective resolution to disputes than traditional litigation. The deposit serves as a financial commitment to the process, ensuring that only those who are serious about resolving their disputes will participate.\n","\n","In every legal contract, parties are assumed to have read, understood, and agreed to its terms. The appellant, by choosing to enter into the contract and subsequently challenging this clause, has demonstrated a deliberate decision to do so.\n","\n","Furthermore, the arbitration clause does not prevent access to arbitration but rather tempers it. It is not uncommon for parties to enter into contracts with similar provisions in a variety of industries. This practice is not arbitrary but is a recognized and widely accepted method of encouraging responsible behavior.\n","\n","We understand the appellant's concerns about accessibility. Yet, it \n","\n","DEFENSE: Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, today you are tasked with upholding the foundational principle that the law of our land is not just a set of rules but the embodiment of our collective commitment to justice and individual rights. As we navigate through the evidence presented, I ask that you consider the Constitution, a beacon of guidance that guarantees every American the right to a fair trial.\n","\n","\n","The prosecution will attempt to paint a picture of guilt based on circumstantial evidence, but in the pursuit of justice, the scales must not tip without solid proof. Let us remember that it is the duty of the state to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, my client's guilt. In the landmark decision of *Miranda v. Arizona* (1966), it was established that any evidence obtained without proper Miranda warnings is inadmissible, as it violates the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination. The prosecution has failed to provide clear evidence that my client was informed of these rights, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the subsequent statements made.\n","\n","\n","Furthermore, the prosecution's reliance on a single eyewitness testimony is a risky gambit. Eyewitness testimony, as we know, can be unreliable and influenced by numerous factors. In *Perry v. New Hampshire* (2012), the Court recognized the potential for wrongful convictions based solely on such testimony. It is our role to implore the jury to consider the possibility of misidentification, especially in a case where the witness was under duress.\n","\n","\n","In closing, I urge you to keep the spirit of our Constitution at the forefront of your deliberations. The evidence presented does not meet the stringent standard of proof required. I trust that you, upholding the principles of justice, will find that the prosecution has not proven my client's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Thank you. \n","#### How does the defense counsel ensure that the jury understands the significance of the Miranda rights in the context of the case? The defense counsel emphasizes the importance of Miranda rights by highlighting the legal precedent set in *Miranda v. Arizona* (1966).

I will avoid becoming argumentative, evasive, or emotionally reactive during the proceedings.\n","\n","Furthermore, I understand the importance of following the judge’s instructions and refraining from making unsolicited remarks or providing commentary outside the scope of my expertise unless specifically asked as an expert witness.

My name is Dr. Elizabeth Nguyen, and I am a forensic toxicologist with over 15 years of experience in analyzing substances related to criminal cases. I am here today to present my findings on the presence of trace amounts of an illegal substance in the defendant's system, which could be pertinent to the charges they face.\n","\n","My analysis was conducted following the American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS) guidelines and using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), a reliable method for detecting and quantifying substances in biological samples.\n","\n","I would like to clarify that my role is solely to provide the court with an expert opinion based on scientific evidence. My findings are not an indication of the defendant's guilt or innocence.\n","\n","I will now detail my methodology, results, and the conclusions reached from the data. \n","\n","PROSECUTOR: Ladies and Gentlemen of the Court,\n","\n","As the defense begins their opening statement, I would like to offer a brief rebuttal. The defense argues that the arbitration clause in question is a barrier to accessing arbitration, making it inaccessible for parties facing disputes. However, this argument fails to consider the broader context and purpose of such clauses.\n","\n","Arbitration clauses, including the one in question, are not intended to create barriers but to ensure that the process remains fair, efficient, and accessible to all parties. The clause requiring a 10% deposit is not arbitrary, but rather a necessary measure to prevent frivolous claims and ensure parties are serious about resolving their disputes.\n","\n","The defense also suggests that the clause restricts access to arbitration. However, this is not the case. Parties who cannot afford to pay a deposit are still entitled to seek arbitration. The requirement of a deposit, while strict, is a common practice in many industries and is recognized globally.\n","\n","We acknowledge the appellant's concerns about potential financial constraints. However, it is essential to maintain a balance between accessibility and preventing misuse of the arbitration process. The clause in question serves this purpose by establishing a level playing field for all parties involved.\n","\n","In conclusion, we maintain that the arbitration clause is a vital component of the contract, designed to ensure fairness, efficiency, and accessibility in dispute resolution. We look forward to demonstrating its validity throughout this case. \n","\n","JUDGE: This case involves plaintiff Jennifer Smith, who has filed a lawsuit against defendant John Doe for breach of contract. The complaint details that Mr. Doe failed to deliver services agreed upon in a written contract, causing substantial losses for Ms. Smith's business.\n","\n","\n","During the preliminary hearing, Mr. Doe's defense counsel raised an objection to the admittance of certain emails between Ms. Smith and an ex-employee, claiming they are hearsay and not relevant to the contract in question. After reviewing the evidence, I find the objection to be well-taken. The emails in question do not pertain directly to the contractual agreement and, as such, are not admissible. This ruling is in accordance with Federal Rule of Evidence 401 and 402, which dictate the relevance of evidence.\n","\n","\n","In addition, during cross-examination, defense counsel for Mr. Doe improperly asked a line of questioning that could be construed as inflammatory and prejudicial towards Ms. Smith. This line of questioning goes beyond the scope of permissible cross-examination and may unduly influence the jury. Therefore, I hereby restrict the scope of cross-examination to only those questions directly relating to the breach of contract. This ruling upholds the ethical standards set forth under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which prohibits the admission of evidence that is more prejudicial than probative.\n","\n","\n","This court remains committed to ensuring a fair trial for all parties involved. I trust that both counsel will adhere to these rulings, maintaining the integrity of the judicial process.\n","\n","• *Judge [Your Name]*\n","\n","\n","## Instruction 2 (More Difficult) \n","\n"]}],"source":["# court room\n","\n","\n","from __future__ import annotations\n","import os\n","from typing import List, Dict\n","from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient\n","\n","\n","class LawyerAgent:\n","\n","\n","    def __init__(self,\n","                 name: str,\n","                 system_prompt: str,\n","                 model: str = \"microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\"):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.system_prompt = system_prompt.strip()\n","        self.history: List[Dict[str, str]] = []      # list of {\"role\": ..., \"content\": ...}\n","        self.client = InferenceClient(\n","            model,\n","            token=os.getenv(\"HF_API_TOKEN\")           # make sure this env‑var is set\n","        )\n","\n","    # ---- helper for HF prompt formatting ----------\n","    def _format_prompt(self, user_msg: str) -> str:\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Formats a full prompt that includes\n","        * system prompt\n","        * prior turns\n","        * new user message\n","        \"\"\"\n","        messages = [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": self.system_prompt}]\n","        messages.extend(self.history)\n","        messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_msg})\n","\n","        # HF text-generation endpoints expect a single string.\n","\n","        prompt = \"\"\n","        for m in messages:\n","            prompt += f\"<|{m['role']}|>\\n{m['content']}\\n\"\n","        prompt += \"<|assistant|>\\n\"\n","        return prompt\n","\n","    # ---- produce a reply --------------------------\n","    def respond(self, user_msg: str, **gen_kwargs) -> str:\n","        prompt = self._format_prompt(user_msg)\n","        completion =  self.client.text_generation(\n","            prompt,\n","            max_new_tokens=512,\n","            temperature=0.7,\n","            do_sample=True,\n","            stream=False,\n","            **gen_kwargs\n","        )\n","        answer = completion.strip()\n","        # keep chat memory\n","        self.history.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_msg})\n","        self.history.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": answer})\n","        return answer\n","\n","\n","# System prompts\n","\n","DEFENSE_SYSTEM = \"\"\"\n","You are **Alex Carter**, lead *defense counsel*.\n","Goals:\n","• Protect the constitutional rights of the defendant.\n","• Raise reasonable doubt by pointing out missing evidence or alternative explanations.\n","• Be respectful to the Court and to opposing counsel.\n","Style:\n","• Crisp, persuasive, grounded in precedent and facts provided.\n","• When citing precedent: give short case name + year (e.g., *Miranda v. Arizona* (1966)).\n","Ethics:\n","• Do not fabricate evidence; admit uncertainty when required.\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","PROSECUTION_SYSTEM = \"\"\"\n","You are **Jordan Blake**, *Assistant District Attorney* for the State.\n","Goals:\n","• Present the strongest good‑faith case against the accused.\n","• Lay out facts logically, citing exhibits or witness statements when available.\n","• Anticipate and rebut common defense arguments.\n","Style:\n","• Formal but plain English; persuasive, with confident tone.\n","Ethics:\n","• Duty is to justice, not merely to win.
